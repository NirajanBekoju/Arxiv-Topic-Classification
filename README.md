# Arxiv Topic Classification

## Abstract
In todayâ€™s information-rich world, scientific publications play a pivotal role in disseminating
knowledge and advancing research across various disciplines. The exponential growth of digital
repositories, such as arXiv, has made it increasingly challenging for researchers to keep up with
the vast volume of available literature. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach
that harnesses the power of Kaggle datasets for arXiv paper topic classification and builds a
robust recommendation system.

## Data Source
