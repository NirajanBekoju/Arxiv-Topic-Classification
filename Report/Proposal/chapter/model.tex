\chapter{Model Development and Evaluation}

\section{Model Development}
Model for the multi label classification can be developed using Embedding, LSTMs and Dense layers. Moreover, Transformer model can also be used for creating this classification model.

The recommendation system can be developed by taking the layer of dense layer as features of the paper and calculating the similarities between the paper. This can be used to recommend new paper given some input paper.

\section{Model Evaluation}
Various evaluation metrics like Hamming Loss, Subset Accuracy will be used for the multi label classification.

Since our data is highly imbalanced, Hamming Loss is suitable as the evaluation metrics.
